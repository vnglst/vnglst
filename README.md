## Hi there, I'm Koen! 👋🏼

I'm a passionate & entrepreneurial tech lead from the Netherlands who likes to push the web beyond it's limits. I specialize in modern web development using React and I also feel at home on the backend using TypeScript or Python. I'm interested in helping inspiring companies create innovative web apps that users love.
